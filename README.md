# Superstitions
A Minecraft 1.10 pack with something old and something new.

Work in Progress

Are you fed up and bored with yourself for starting a new Minecraft pack and server and doing the same mods over and over because they are mods which you know well and don't have to learn? Well this is the pack for you, with all your favorite mods which you CAN'T play with until you learn a new, not widely used mod. 

Well known mods such as EnderIO, Mekanism, Immersive Engineering which you love to play with ...... you CAN'T .... until you unlock them through learning other mods.

Don't ask me to unlock the mods either, go play another pack and do your old boring progression which you will always do.
